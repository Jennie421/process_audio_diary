# if called by pipeline will have study variable already set, but to allow modular usage prompt for study of interest if variable is unset

 	# makes it easier to track which files have already been processed this way, and the corresponding metadata and transcript name (if available) can be found by referring to the DPDash formatted outputs the pipeline creates
 	# (see the "filename" column in the DPDash formatted AudioQC output for a given patient to match to the OpenSMILE output names)
 	# future steps of the pipeline that summarize OpenSMILE results will move away from this convention and focus on day numbers however
 	# may also add a utility in the future for sharing raw OpenSMILE outputs (as we deem those non-PII) by simply copying/renaming all the existing OpenSMILE outputs into a new folder, transferring that folder using input SFTP settings, and then deleting it locally.
